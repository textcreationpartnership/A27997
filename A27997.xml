            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THIS Book is intitled the Book of</hi> Job, <hi>it being indeed an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of</hi> Job, <hi>as of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and his Sore and Heavy Trials, and exemplary Patience; ſo of the bleſſed End which the Lord at length made, his Sore Tryals ending in glorious Triumphs, and his Sorrows, in great Rejoicings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is indeed a moſt excellent Book, full of various and moſt excellent Matter, which we ſhould be well acquainted with, and much vers'd in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We have in it many High and Lofty Diſcoveries of God, and of his glorious Attributes, and Perfections, as of his Wiſdom, Power, Glory, Majeſty, Greatneſs, Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Incomprehenſibleneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:32065:5"/>
2. <hi>We have a Deſcription of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works, and wonderful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providence, providing for all ſorts of Creatures,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Here we have much held forth, not only of the Creator, but alſo of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which Manifeſt, and Declare the Glory of the Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We have here an Example of the greateſt Piety, moſt invincible Patience, and ſweet Submiſſiveneſs; under the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſpenſations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We have here held forth the Happy End, that God makes in afflicting his People, and that he is very pitiful, and of tender Mercy,</hi> James 5. 11.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>We are here inſtructed, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Things very obſervable, and of great Importance. As,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Perſons may be very Great, and yet Gracious, and Good, very Rich and yet Righteous, very Wealthy and yet Vertuous, as we ſee here in</hi> Job. <hi>And this is a Bleſſed Conjunction indeed, but very Rare, Riches expoſing ſo much to Vice, and the Snares, and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch, being ſo many and great;
<pb facs="tcp:32065:5"/>
hence ſays our Saviour to his Diſciples (and he puts a Verily to it)</hi> A Rich Man ſhall hardly enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. <hi>All hardly, but they hardlier than others, if Truth it ſelf may be believed:</hi> But though with Men it is impoſſible, but not with God, with whom all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>He can withdraw the Heart, from the inordinate Love of them, and from truſting in them, but how hard is this, and hence (which is very obſervable) when Jeſus Chriſt had explained himſelf,</hi> Mark 10. 24. Children how hard is it for them that truſt in Riches to enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>yet then it is ſaid,</hi> they were aſtoniſhed out of meaſure, <hi>&amp;c. Becauſe it is ſo hard to have Riches, and not to truſt, in them; hence</hi> Paul <hi>beſpeaks</hi> Timothy, To charge them that are Rich in this World, not to truſt in them, <hi>&amp;c. 1. Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19. and therefore for ſuch to be Good, as</hi> Job <hi>here was, it is to be good indeed, and to be one of a Thouſand. Read</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:32065:6"/>
2. <hi>We are taught here, that Perſons of the greateſt Integrity, may be exercis'd with the greateſt Calamities, whilſt the Wicked Proſper in the World, are Secure, and increaſe in Riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the higheſt, and beſt founded Eſtate here, as to outward Things is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That Afflictions are not by Chance, but are ordered by Divine Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>What undaunted Courage, and ſtrong Conſolation, Integrity gives in Times of Trial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>We have here in a Word, a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and variety of all Learning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of all Philoſophy and Divinity, ſo that this Book may well be ſtil'd as one Calls it,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now the greateſt Part of this Book being in the Original, in Verſe, yea, all but the two firſt Chapters, and Part of the Laſt; and it being a Book of ſo great Excellency, and containing in it, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and excellent things, I have ſpent ſome time, and no ſmall Pains to turn many of them into Verſe, and have
<pb facs="tcp:32065:6"/>
reduc'd them to certain Heads, that they might be the better known, and the better made uſe of; I do not pretend to Poetry, neither do I much Paraphraſe upon the Words, but for the moſt Part keep cloſe to them as they are tranſlated, which I judge meeteſt in turning Divine Things into Meeter. And now as I looked upon this, as that which might be very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, and ſerviceable to my Self, ſo if through the Bleſſing of God, it ſhall but any ways prove ſo to others, which is that I deſign therein, I ſhall think my Time and Pains well beſtowed, however let an attempt thereto, be accepted.</hi>
